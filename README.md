### Acknowledgements

I'm grateful to Michael Shilov for sharing the [starter code](http://scraping.pro/simple-email-crawler-python/) for this project: "This crawler is simple and is deficient in several features (like saving found emails into a file), but it gives you some basic principles of email crawling. I give it to you for further improvement."
